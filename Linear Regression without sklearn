# Define the dataset
X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Input features
y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]  # Corresponding labels

# Calculate the mean of X and y
mean_x = sum(X) / len(X)
mean_y = sum(y) / len(y)

# Calculate the slope and intercept of the regression line
numerator = sum([(X[i] - mean_x) * (y[i] - mean_y) for i in range(len(X))])
denominator = sum([(x - mean_x) ** 2 for x in X])
slope = numerator / denominator
intercept = mean_y - slope * mean_x

# Use the regression line to make predictions
new_data = [6, 7, 8]  # New input data
predictions = [slope * x + intercept for x in new_data]

# Print the slope, intercept, and predictions
print("Slope:", slope)
print("Intercept:", intercept)
print("Predictions for new data:", predictions)
